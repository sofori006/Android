# Android

## Kotlin 
We will be using the Kotlin Programming language for this series of 
tutorials because the prefered language for Android now is Kotlin as
stated by Google developers.

Kotlin is now prefered to Java because it offers simplified way of presenting
Java. You may say both Kotlin and Java or similer just that Kotlin is really 
simplified.
